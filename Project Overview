Objective: Use past avocado data such as price, type (conventional/organic), size, location, climate to predict (Machine Learning)...

        - Price in specific regions
        - Whether avocado's are overpriced / underpriced, which season?
        - How each region fares in each season?
        - What does climate change have to do with avocado prices
        - Organic vs Conventional, in season vs out of season
        - Most expensive avocados vs Least expensive avocados
           
Data Source: hassavocadoboard.com      

Demand Side: How much is sold?
Supply Side: How much is grown?

Goal By Tuesday:
  - Get complete dataset and clean it (supply/demand, climate data, price data)

Presentation Ideas:
  - Heatmap, Line graph for price over time, Box and Whisker (interactive, show high price, low price, volume, etc.)
  - Dropdown Menu? --> Location, show the graph of the city you selected

Cleaning:


User Interaction:
        - Map Idea:
                - Click on city, zoom in on the region/city, tooltip pops up to enter date --> display visuals / predictions below map
        - Text/Dropdown/Input Idea:
                - Enter city, then enter date --> generate visuals and predictive model


Visualizations:
        - Average Prices, Volume, Conventional/Organic
                - HeatMap: National & Regional
                        - Average Prices, Volume/Avg Sum
                        - Organized by either zip code, city, or lat/long
                - Line Graph: Price vs. Production
                        - Average, Sum
                        - By Region
                - Monetary Statistic Table ?
                        - Numerical Representations
                        - Prices vs other Cities (ex: 9th of 50th)
        - Type of Avocado / Size of Avocado
                - Where are certain types and certain sizes going? Large cities?
                - When are the sizes / types of avocados most prevalent? (months)
                - 
             
             
Other Ideas:
        - Compare to baseline fruit/veggie (ex: corn, potato, etc)
        - Global data intro --> reference before zooming on US

To DO:

All - find datasets
Tyler - pricing models/patterns (by region?), above/below national/regional avgs, conventional/organic
Ryan - look into patterns, visualizations 
Alex - create the predictive variables --> avocado type, bag size
